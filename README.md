# Biomedical Concept Discovery

### Setup

First install either [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your system. We prefer Miniconda since it is more minimal and will take less time to install.

Next, create a conda environment and then activate it.

```bash
$  conda create -n concept_disc python=3.7
$  conda activate concept_disc
```
